Hello and welcome to BacteriaSim.
This a simulation of bacteria natural selection (and a variation of random walk).

Notable extensions:

GUI: gui written in PYQT5, looking fresh and easy to use.

Timeline: A slider that allows the user to go back and forth in the simulation.

Jump to generation: A helpful feature that allows the user to jump to a specific generation
    in the future.

Simulation settings: the ability to change the settings, from speed of the simulation, mutation 
    rate, food spawn rate, board size, and more.

Live statistics: graph page that updates in real time.

And more!
